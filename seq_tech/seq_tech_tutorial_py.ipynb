    "## Initial setup: Work environment and Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The starter notebook contains instructions for setting up your `conda` environment. Please follow these instructions, then continue using the notebook to write the commands used here and take notes for the exercises. You can also download a copy from [here](seq_tech_tutorial_py.ipynb) for your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will serve as both a rudimentary pipeline and final (reproducible) report.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Notebook usage example](img/notebook_usage.drawio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not done so already, you need to first install `conda`. See instructions [here](../unix/conda_install.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directory and data setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working in Jupyter Lab and primarely writing the commands in this Jupyter Notebook. However, the first commands in this section are easier if you run from the terminal. (Note that depending on how you have things set up on your computer, you may have access to a Unix terminal within Jupyter Lab. Simply do: \"File\" → \"New\" → \"Terminal\" and a terminal will open in a new tab in Jupyter Lab.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please create a directory for this tutorial in your home directory and inside there copy the starter notebook from my directory. To do this run the following commands in the terminal after logging on to the server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd\n",
    "mkdir NGS_Tutorial\n",
    "cp /PATH/TO/FILES/NGS_Tutorial/seq_tech_tutorial_py.ipynb NGS_Tutorial/\n",
    "cd NGS_Tutorial\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now fetch a copy of the data we will be using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cp -r /PATH/TO/FILES/NGS_Tutorial/data .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To nicely see the contents of (small) directories, you can use the `tree` program, but you may need to install it first (`conda install tree`)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "tree data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also run `ls *` (which works on any system).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure this data is protected from accidental writes, remove the write permission (`-w`) for anyone on the server (`ugo`) on it by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "find data -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod ugo-w\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then create a results directory: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir results\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Container\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, as with other tutorials for this course, you will be using a container. In this case, the `sequencing-conda-container.sif` container, located in the `/cephyr/NOBACKUP/groups/bbt045_2024/Container/` directory, just like the container you used earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run this Jupyter Notebook, you will need to copy the `run_jupyter.sh` script to your new `NGS_Tutorial/` directory, and edit the file path for the container. In other words, in the `run_jupyter.sh` script, replace the name of the container you used previously (`bbt045.sif`) with the name of the container you will be using for this exercise (`sequencing-conda-container.sif`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you will be using this container, the following instructions regarding the creation of a `conda` environment to run this Notebook in are irrelevant for you. However, I am leaving them in for you to reference, and will briefly cover them in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "It's standard practice to create a new `conda` environment for each project. This is because each project may require a number of different software packages, with certain versions. Even if these requirements are very similar between the projects, even small differences may topple the house of cards that is the software ecosystem. This is officially referred to as [\"dependency hell\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell) and can cause you _more than a little_ frustration (to put it _mildly_).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Conda` can fetch packages from many different sources (aka \"channels\"). Let's add the Bioconda channel, as well as the general-purpose conda-forge channel (\"defaults\" is given first to give it top priority when searching for packages).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignore any errors about \" Inappropriate ioctl for device\" and \"no job control in this shell\". They're a harmless consequence of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the channels by running the following in your Unix terminal (not in your Jupyter Notebook):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# adding conda channels\n",
    "conda config --add channels defaults\n",
    "conda config --add channels bioconda\n",
    "conda config --add channels conda-forge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up our environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Create and activate a new environment for this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `conda create` command creates new environments, the option `--name` (or `-n`) specifies the name of your new environment and the option `-y` lets `conda` know that you answer \"yes\" to all prompts. Without `-y` you will have to manually type in \"yes\" or \"y\" when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command `conda activate` activates the environment within the current code chunk **and only the current code chunk**. Which means that within every code chunk that we want to use our environment we need to first run `conda activate <environment_name>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create and activate the `conda` environment used for this exercise by running the following in your Unix terminal (not in your Jupyter Notebook):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name sequencing -y\n",
    "# you can activate the environment by running: \n",
    "conda activate sequencing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing relevant software\n",
    "\n",
    "Now install the software needed for this exercise. We want to install the software on to our new environment so we first activate the environment with `conda activate`. The command `conda install` will install the packages that you specify to it. You can specify multiple packages at a time by separating them with spaces. This step will also ask for confirmation if we do not specify the `-y` option. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later on/in real life, it's good to to examine what changes are made when installing new packages. You can easily view all the packages installed in an environment by running `conda list` once the environment is activated. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure you activated the `sequencing` environment!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, run the following lines of code from your Unix terminal: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate sequencing\n",
    "# conda install gsl==2.5 samtools bowtie2 breseq abyss bcftools wgsim emboss tree ncurses -y\n",
    "# you can often install all packages in a conda environment as shown above\n",
    "# however in this case, it's actually quicker to run multiple commands: \n",
    "conda install gsl==2.5\n",
    "# this is necessary to prevent a dependency issue with bcftools\n",
    "# ref: https://www.biostars.org/p/9480029/#9573995\n",
    "conda install -c bioconda samtools\n",
    "conda install -c bioconda bowtie2 \n",
    "conda install -c bioconda breseq \n",
    "conda install -c bioconda abyss \n",
    "conda install -c bioconda bcftools \n",
    "conda install -c bioconda wgsim \n",
    "conda install -c bioconda emboss \n",
    "conda install tree\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge ncurses\n",
    "# otherwise ncurses may install without a version number, which will cause samtools to raise an error\n",
    "# ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72103046/libtinfo-so-6-no-version-information-available-message-using-conda-environment\n",
    "# and install a few python libraries\n",
    "conda install pandas seaborn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets inspect the packages that we just installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate sequencing\n",
    "conda list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running `conda` in Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Jupyter is packaged within an Anaconda installation, you should be able to run `conda` commands directly from this Jupyter Notebook with just a little modification. Simply install the IPython kernel in any environment you wish to use in Jupyter Notebooks, **and** the `nb_conda_kernels` program in your `base` `conda` environment. Do this now in your Unix terminal, where you have the `sequencing` environment activated. \n",
    "\n",
    "**PLEASE NOTE!!!** Enable the creation of a kernel only _after_ you have installed all of the programs you intend to install in your environment! Starting with the `ipykernel` installation can raise errors that will prevent you from installing the programs you are actually going to use in your environment! \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# do this inside of your working conda environment, not in the base environment\n",
    "conda install ipykernel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now create a kernel for the `conda` environment, by running the following in that same Unix terminal: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# you can run this from the base conda environment\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name=sequencing\n",
    "# this should return soemthing like: \n",

    "```\n",

    "For more information, check out [this website](https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-use-conda-environment-in-a-jupyter-notebook/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have installed the above in your environment, you also need to install the `nb_conda_kernels` program in your `base` `conda` environment: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# in base conda environment\n",
    "conda install conda-forge::nb_conda_kernels\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be able to activate the `sequencing` `conda` environment within this Jupyter Notebook, by selecting the `Python [conda env:sequencing]` kernel within Jupyter Lab. Since you will be working within a kernel made from your `conda` environment, there will be no need to run `conda activate sequencing` in any of the cells in this Notebook. (There should also be a `sequencing` kernel, but you likely won't be able to run programs installed in the environment using this kernel.) This can be done either from the kernel display at the top right side of the Jupyter Lab screen, or via \"Kernel\" → \"Change Kernel...\" → select the kernel of choice\n",
