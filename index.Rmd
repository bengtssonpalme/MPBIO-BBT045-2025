## Tutorial: Intro to Python programming for data analysis

**Tutorial**

[Python Intro Tutorial](python_for_data_analysis/intro_python_data_analysis.html)

**Homework**

* [HW 2: Python for Data Analysis](python_for_data_analysis/homework_python_intro.html)
* To be submitted on Canvas by February 5th.

**Reading**

A selection of small chapters and sections that explain concepts we cover in the course:

- [*An Introduction to Programming for Bioscientists: A Python-Based Primer*](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004867) by Ekmekci et al.
    - This PLoS article is a good overview/introduction to the use of Python for data science. 
    - Some aspects may seem confusing in the beginning, but Python (like all languages, programming or otherwise) is best learned through _use_. As you work your way through this course, this article can be used a reference. 

- [*Python for Data Analysis, 3E*](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) by Wes McKinney
    - An alternative option for exploring the use of Python in the context of data analysis & scientific computing
    - Much more detailed than the PLoS article above, but less relevant for bioinformatics - a potentially useful reference

- [*Intro to Advanced Python*](https://python-course.eu/advanced-python/) by Bernd Klein
    - This website provides resources for some of the more advanced utility of Python, which can improve your overall coding ability. 
    - The [*Intro to Python Tutorial*](https://python-course.eu/python-tutorial/) portion of the same website has more basic introductory materials, if you like all of your references to be in the same place. 

- Official documentation pages: You do not need to read these in their entirety, but they can provide helpful information for a variety of the modules we will be using. Here, I will include a few of the basics: 
    - Python programming language official website: https://www.python.org/
    - Pandas documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/
    - Numpy documentation: https://numpy.org/
    - Scipy (Python for scientific computing): https://scipy.org/
    - Re (regex/regular expressions in Python): https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
    - Biopython: https://biopython.org/

- Miscellaneous :) There are many good resource on the web. We'll point out some when relevant.
